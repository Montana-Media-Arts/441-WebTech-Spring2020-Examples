# Week 9

I actually had a lot of fun with this assignment. I believe I did it correctly. I didn't find it too difficult, but I definitely had to supplement the lessons with a good amount of my own research. I was sick for most of these two weeks, so I needed a lot of refreshing as to what JSON and AJAX are, but now Im feeling mostly pretty confident with it all.

I feel like Im starting to see how these basics can make almost anything possible.
